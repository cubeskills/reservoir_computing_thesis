# Reservoir Computing Framework

A framework for Reservoir Computing systems.

## Overview

This project presents a principled, efficient, and automated method for tuning reservoir computers using intrinsic dynamics measures rather than expensive task-specific searches. 

## The Problem We Solve

### The "Black-Box Art" of Reservoir Tuning
- Optimizing key hyperparameters (spectral radius, input scaling) typically requires exhaustive, task-specific searches
- Traditional methods are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications
- Physical reservoir systems (photonic circuits, biological substrates) don't allow direct parameter setting

### The Physical Reservoir Challenge
In physical systems, you can't simply set a spectral radius - you can only influence global properties like:
- Temperature
- Voltage  
- Physical constraints

This makes traditional optimization methods **impractical**.

## Our Solution: Closed-Loop Unsupervised Control

Instead of using expensive task performance measurements, our controller uses **intrinsic, task-agnostic measures** derived from the reservoir's internal dynamics.

### Key Innovation
A **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** learns the complex, nonlinear relationship between internal dynamics and task performance, enabling real-time hyperparameter optimization.

## Intrinsic Measures

Our framework leverages measures from **information theory** and **state-space analysis**:

### Information Theoretic Measures
- **Average State Entropy** - captures dynamical complexity
- **Active Information Storage** - quantifies memory capacity
- **Transfer Entropy** - measures information transfer between components

### State-Space Complexity Measures  

- **Participation Ratio** - measures effective dimensionality of state space
- **Variance of Activation Derivatives** - quantifies nonlinearity
- **Mean Correlation** - measures synchronization

## How the Controller Works

```
1. OBSERVE → Monitor reservoir's internal dynamics through intrinsic measures
2. PREDICT → SVM classifier predicts optimal hyperparameter directions  
3. ACT → Update hyperparameters (increase/decrease/stay)
4. REPEAT → Iterative optimization without expensive retraining
```

## Key Findings & Contributions

### Nonlinearity is Essential
- The relationship between internal measures and task performance is **highly nonlinear**
- Nonlinear models (SVMs) significantly outperform linear approaches

### Accurate Guidance
- High classification accuracy for hyperparameter direction prediction
- Successful optimization across diverse task types

### Transferable Intelligence
- Controllers trained on simple tasks (e.g., memory tasks) successfully optimize for complex, unseen tasks (e.g., NARMA10)
- **No re-optimization needed** for new problems

### Practical Viability
- Real-time steering from poor to optimal performance regimes
- Computationally efficient - no expensive grid searches required

### Hardware-Ready
- Only requires **observable data** and **external controls**
- Interesting applciation for physical reservoirs where internal weights are inaccessible are possible

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd reservoir_framework

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Or install dependencies directly
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from reservoir.core.reservoir import Reservoir
from reservoir.training.trainer import ReservoirTrainer
from reservoir.utils.measures import Measures

# Create and configure reservoir
trainer = build_reservoir(
    input_dim=3,
    reservoir_size=100,
    spectral_radius=1.2,
    scale=0.5,
    seed=42
)

# Train on task
trainer.train(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions  
y_pred = trainer.predict(X_test)

# Compute intrinsic measures
measures = Measures(trainer.current_history, trainer.states)
ase = measures.average_state_entropy()
...
...
...
